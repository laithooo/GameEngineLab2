The object can generate multiple bullets of different sizes but with the same objective: to knock the player out. Generates cylinders, spheres, and cubes
This is a good choice because it adds unpredictability in a fully fleshed out game, and you can also add different properties to each projectile in order to keep the game exciting

*Used ai to help  me generate proper code for the turret, needed assistance with the multiple gameobjects
